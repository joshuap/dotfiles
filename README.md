## Requirements

This project depends on `git` and [`rcm`](http://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to *~/.dotfiles*.

On the first run:

```sh
env RCRC=$HOME/.dotfiles/rcrc rcup
```

On subsequent runs: `rcup`

## OS X

The following packages are required for OS X (I install them with homebrew):
